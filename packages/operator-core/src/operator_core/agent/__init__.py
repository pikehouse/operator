Agent module for AI-powered diagnosis and action.

This module contains:
- diagnosis.py: Pydantic models for structured diagnosis output
- (future) runner.py: Agent runner daemon that processes tickets

- (future) prompt.py: System prompts and template construction

Per PROJECT.md: "AI demonstrates real diagnostic reasoning about
distributed systems - not just 'something is wrong' but 'here's what's
happening, here are the options, here's why I'd choose this one.'"
